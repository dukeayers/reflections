When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working with more than one person on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It may cause a merge conflict on your local files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are when you don't have permisson to clone and alter someone else's repo. Clones are when you want to alter the current repository. Branches are when you want to work on something that may or may not be relevant to the current code base.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows you the opportunity to reference the last known working copy of a specific codebase. Which then you can appropriately branch off of, merge into, or do other things.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We could use SVN... But really, I guess you would be in control of your own version control system and it could be extremely hard to manage the changes. There may be no benefits depending on the type of version control you use.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a separate branch when you are attempting to bring in a new feature or maybe edit some existing feature. I would make a new branch if I would want to experiment with the current codebase and potentially add on to it or test to see what changes I could make that would result in an improvement.
